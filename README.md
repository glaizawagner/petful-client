## About this project

FIFO Adoption Agency adopts animals such as dogs and cats that have been rescued or surrendered. Adoption works on a first come, first served basis not only for animals but for people who are interested to adopt. If it is your turn to adopt, you have the option to adopt a cat or a dog or both. 
For people who are interested to adopt, they can see the complete details of the cat, dog, or cat/dog pair that is ready for adoption as well as the people who are next in line for adoption. They can add their name so that it will be added to the queue as the next prospective owner.
